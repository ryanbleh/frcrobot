# 2024 Crescendo Robot 
This was my first ever design project which I've invested 50+ hours into. While this design is not the most strategicly optimized, I am very proud of the skills learnt.

## Intake

This is a 4 bar intake which is able to intake the 2024 game piece, notes. The rollers are dead-axle with 2 inch diameter polytube. This was the first mechanism designed, 
which caused a lot of the geometry for the robot to be a bit sketchy. 

## Indexer

Due to the funky geometry of the intake, this indexer has to do some weird stuff to be able to be usable. It is powered by a 3:1 Falcon 550. 

## Shooter

This shooter is loosely inspired by FRC 1540's shooter from this year. This is the least complete mechanism, and I plan to signifigantly overhaul the design at a later date. 

## Drivetrain

This is a 29" x 29" drivetrain powered by 8 falcons on a SDS m4ki swerve base.
